macOS Tahoe 26 Release Notes
Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.
Overview

The macOS 26 SDK provides support to develop apps for Mac computers running Tahoe 26. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26, see Xcode 26 Release Notes.

General
New Features

Recovery Assistant is a new way to recover your device if it doesn’t start up normally. It can look for problems and attempt to resolve them if found. (151856202)

AGL
Deprecations

AGL is no longer available in the macOS SDK. AGL was previously used to present OpenGL content in Carbon apps, and Carbon no longer exists in the SDK. AGL symbols now do nothing on 64-bit systems, including Intel x86_64 and Apple Silicon Macs. It is safe to remove any AGL usage and stop linking AGL. OpenGL still remains in the SDK. (153913819)

AirPlay
Known Issues

AutoMix song transitions might not work as expected when streaming with AirPlay. (155925891)

App Store
New Features

A new Accessibility section has been added to the App Store product pages that highlights accessibility features within apps and games. These Accessibility Nutrition Labels give users a new way to learn if an app will be accessible to them before they download it, and give developers the opportunity to better inform and educate their users on features their app supports. (138344118)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: Updating iOS or iPadOS apps on macOS from the App Store might hang with a spinning progress indicator or with the progress partially complete. (152878930)

AppKit
Resolved Issues

Fixed: With TextKit, the textRangeByIntersectingWithTextRange method in NSTextRange does not return nil for non-intersecting ranges. (138067979)

Apple Intelligence
New Features

The Foundation Models framework provides you with direct access to the on-device large language model at the core of Apple Intelligence. For release notes about the framework, see the Foundation Models framework section below. (139996377)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: In Image Playground and Genmoji, the new modifiers to customize appearance do not work for Japanese-language users. Image creation is blocked when attempting to add modifiers to its appearance. (151833204)

Fixed: Model quality output degrades after extended, repeated inferences of the same adapter. (152468267)

Known Issues

Xcode features like Predictive Code Completion and the coding assistant might require Apple Intelligence to be enabled. (150889516)

Workaround: Enable Apple Intelligence in System Settings.

AssistantSchemas
Resolved Issues

Fixed: If you have adopted any of the following email AssistantSchemas, you will experience a compilation error due to a parameter type change: createDraft, updateDraft, replyMail, forwardMail, message, and draft. (148633307)

AuthenticationServices
New Features

ASAuthorizationControllerRequestOptions.preferImmediatelyAvailableCredentials now works for passkey registration requests. This request only shows UI when the device is immediately able to create a passkey; otherwise, no UI is shown. (150688929)

AVFoundation
Resolved Issues

Fixed: AVPlayerLayer does not ensure a valid video frame is always displayed during item replacement, as the isReadyForDisplay property does not remain true during transitions. (151902458)

Background Assets
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The system might not update downloaded asset packs as frequently as is expected for apps that internal testers install from TestFlight. (143281558)

Fixed: Asset pack downloads might fail unexpectedly or stall indefinitely, including across reboots. (151498902)

Fixed: The system might not deliver status updates to your app for ongoing asset pack downloads. (151647839)

Fixed: An iOS or iPadOS app on an Apple silicon Mac might appear openable in TestFlight even while its essential assets are still being downloaded. (151709449)

Fixed: Pausing and resuming an app installation or update while the system is downloading essential asset packs might cause the installation or update to stall indefinitely. (151942388)

Fixed: The installation of large asset packs might fail. (153128086)

Catalyst
New Features

For Catalyst apps built with the latest SDK, UINavigationItem.title is the window title rather than the window subtitle. (142423319)

For Catalyst apps built with the latest SDK, UIBarButtonSystemItem.fixedSpace and .flexibleSpace are now bridged to NSToolbar. The system no longer ignores fixed and flexible spaces when UIBarButtonItems are automatically converted to the window toolbar in the Mac idiom. However, the width specified via fixedSpaceItem(ofWidth:) is ignored. (145262754)

CloudKit
Resolved Issues

Fixed: CloudKit sharing URLs do not launch third-party apps. (151778655)

Contacts
Known Issues

Characters for Monogram Avatars in some non-English languages might show up as unexpected symbols. (154824077)

CoreData
Resolved Issues

Fixed: In beta 5 SDK, CoreData changed several Sendable annotations to resolve compatibility issues with Swift 6’s new MainActor default isolation feature. These changes include marking NSManagedObject as NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE, marking NSManagedObjectContext as NS_SWIFT_NONISOLATED NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE, and requiring NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE closures for the family of perform, performBlock, performBlockAndWait and similar methods. These changes are ABI compatible with past releases but might introduce new warnings while building source code that violates the longstanding CoreData concurrency guidelines.

NSManagedObject are mutable reference types inextricably related to others in a graph and cannot be made Sendable. They are expected to be isolated to the scope of the NSManagedObjectContext that creates or fetches them. NSManagedObjectContext is a style of actor which encapsulates its own dispatch queue. While it’s impermissible to use many methods on NSManagedObjectContext from other threads, it is permissible to pass references around to invoke the performBlock family of methods, for the purpose of routing a Sendable closure to its managed dispatch queue. CoreData supports a user default -com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1 which can be used to enable additional assertions. (153848710) (FB18216198)

Deprecations

This release removes support for the following deprecated NSPersistentStore option keys:

NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKey

NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKey

NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousPeerTokenOption

NSPersistentStoreRemoveUbiquitousMetadataOption

NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContainerIdentifierKey

NSPersistentStoreRebuildFromUbiquitousContentOption

These keys have been deprecated for more than a decade. Affected apps rebuilt with the iOS or macOS 26 SDK will get errors. Apps built against older SDKs will log warnings when opening the store.

The on-device persistent store will be fully usable after these keys are removed from options dictionary, albeit without syncing. For data syncing, these APIs were superseded by NSPersistentCloudKitContainer in iOS 13 and SwiftData in iOS 17. If absolutely necessary, the iCloud content remains accessible in the containers with the last baseline as a .zip archive file. (157297746) (FB19286235)

Disk Images
New Features

macOS now supports the Apple Sparse Image Format (ASIF). These space-efficient images can be created with the diskutil image command-line tool or the Disk Utility application and are suitable for various uses, including as a backing store for virtual machines storage via the Virtualization framework. See VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment. (152040832)

Documents
Known Issues

EPUB files are shown with an app icon rather than a document icon. Other document types might also be affected. The icon shown is the icon of the app set to open the document. The document opens normally. (154800649)

Finder
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Finder does not display Dark Mode app icons or tinted folder colors when the Folder Color setting in System Settings > Appearance is set to Automatic. (152193702)

Known Issues

Users who enable path bar or status bar in Finder and use list view might be unable to access the last item in the list. (151917092)

Workaround: Disable path bar or status bar temporarily.

Foundation
New Features

Interpolating non-localized types into a LocalizedStringResource/String(localized:)/AttributedString(localized:) value will now display a deprecation warning instead of potentially falling back to a fully-unlocalized string. Provide a localized value to interpolate into the text instead, or silence the warning by wrapping the unlocalized value in a call to String(describing:). (126876158)

ISO8601FormatStyle now allows fractional seconds, regardless of the setting of includingFractionalSeconds. Additionally, ISO8601FormatStyle now allows hours-only time zone offsets. (136950769)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: Functions that initialize a string from a C-string pointer do not validate that the provided encoding is a valid encoding for C-strings. (143756086) (FB16417968)

Foundation Models framework
New Features

LanguageModelSession.prewarm() now caches the instructions and prefix of your prompt, in addition to loading system resources. The best place to use prewarm() is when your app is waiting for user interactions that might trigger response generation. This will reduce the time to the first-generated token. (152381043)

#Playground in Xcode now allows for filing feedback for Foundation Models framework responses. (153770707)

The .contentTagging use case now supports non-English languages. You can query the supported languages using SystemLanguageModel(useCase: .contentTagging).supportedLanguages. Tags will be generated based on the language of the prompt. (155801948)

When you use guided generation, the framework now supports programmatically detecting when and why the model refuses to respond when the content is not unsafe. In previous beta releases, this manifested as a guardrail violation. Now you can catch a specific error case LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.refusal and obtain a model-generated explanation for why it refused to respond. Depending on your use case, you might be able to display the explanation in your UI. (156086748)

In GeneratedContent, you can use the isComplete property to check whether the content was fully generated by the model. (156109416)

When using guided generation, you can now access the underlying weakly typed GeneratedContent by accessing the rawContent property on Response or ResponseStream. (156351123)

New guardrails mode Guardrails.permissiveContentTransformations allows transformations of content that might otherwise violate the default guardrails. Use this mode for text-to-text tasks, such as summarization and rewrite. (156721060)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: When you pass includeSchemaInPrompt: false to respond or streamResponse, it is not respected. (151926006)

Fixed: Custom @Generable types named Number or Boolean might not function reliably in guided generation. (152280144)

Fixed: Tool calling might not function properly if primitive types such as Int, String, or Bool are used as the argument. (152318534)

Fixed: In an Xcode Playground, requests made to the model might receive a “rate limit exceeded” error. (152325506)

Fixed: Model requests in macOS command line tools might experience rate limiting. (152681332)

Fixed: Generable types with a recursive definition lead to a SchemaError when generating a response. (153147722) (FB17962270)

Fixed: A prompt containing Chinese might lead to error “Unsupported language zh-hans detected”. (153151710) (FB17963656)

Fixed: Generable types cannot be made public due to a bug in the Generable macro. (153216183) (FB17990794)

Fixed: Requests to the model might experience rate limiting, even when the device is connected to power. (153216632)

Fixed: The Foundation Models framework cannot be imported when building for Mac Catalyst. (153255533) (FB18004324)

Fixed: Creating a LanguageModelSession with tools that have duplicate names leads to a fatal error. (153426645) (FB18074984)

Fixed: When using guided generation and tool calling together, some requests might lead to LanguageModelSession.GenerationError.decodingFailure due to a bug in constrained decoding. (153773704) (FB18190120)

Fixed: When creating a session with a transcript, any new tools you attach to the session might not be used. Additionally, if your transcript contains tools from a previous session, those tools must be passed as the tools: argument in the new session in order to function properly. (154904647)

Fixed: Some prompts erroneously return an error indicating a guardrail violation (FoundationModels.LanguageModelSession.GenerationError error 2). (155273863)

Fixed: When using tool calling with guided generation, tools might not get called. (155313086) (FB18691470)

Fixed: Generating an enum with associated values through a dynamic schema crashes with a SchemaError. (155957346) (FB18878026)

Fixed: In some cases, requests you make to the model erroneously throw a guardrailViolation for all prompts due to model assets not fully downloaded. (156223847) (FB18944619)

Known Issues

Some instructions and prompts to the model might not lead to expected responses. Use Feedback Assistant to report satisfactory or unsatisfactory cases. When applicable, you can use LanguageModelSession.logFeedbackAttachment() to serialize the feedback to a JSON file and attach it to Feedback Assistant. (152318091)

Workaround: Refine your instructions and prompts using #Playground in Xcode. When applying guided generation with a @Generable type, add @Guide with a custom description on properties to steer the model’s responses.

If Argument type is an enum with associated type, tools will encounter a ToolCallError with an underlying decodingFailure when the model attempts to call it. (156723065)

Workaround: Wrap the enum in a struct.

Full Screen
Resolved Issues

Fixed: You might experience layout issues when going full screen with certain apps on a Mac. (151266898)

Game Controller
New Features

For supported game controllers, pressing the Home button once opens the Game Overlay. Set preferredSystemGestureState to receive additional Home button press events. (137780853)

Pair multiple Apple devices to your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller and easily switch between them directly using the controller or Bluetooth settings. See this PlayStation blog post for details. (137782227)

Game Mode
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The LSSupportsGameMode Info.plist key is currently ignored on macOS. (153125166)

Known Issues

Game Mode will not activate for application binaries spawned directly from Terminal. (153127050)

Workaround: Use the open command to launch your game from Terminal. You can pass arguments, change environment variables, and redirect standard output/error when using this command, such as open MyGame.app --stdout /tmp/mygame.out --stderr /tmp/mygame.err --env MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1 --args -MyGameArgument -AnotherArgument. See man open for more information.

Image Playground
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The Create Image action fails to appear in Shortcuts app and Spotlight. (153235442)

Intel Macs
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Safe and Recovery modes on Intel Macs have performance and graphical issues, though the modes are still functionally usable. Various elements on the screen, such as menus, alerts, and Control Center, might partially display. Scrolling and other operations in some apps cause visual glitches. (149419875)

Keyboard
New Features

In the “ABC – India” keyboard layout, the ₹ (rupee) symbol has replaced the backtick symbol. To type the backtick symbol that’s commonly used in Markdown and some programming contexts, you can use the ⌥ (option) modifier in conjunction with the same key or you can use an alternative layout like “ABC”. (149026394)

Maps
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Users cannot plan a route that leaves at or arrives by a future time. (150947515)

Fixed: If you tap to expand the “Recents” section and there are more recent places than can fit in the view, the Terms & Conditions link will disappear, making it inaccessible. (152197565)

Known Issues

Custom tap gesture callbacks registered using onTapGesture might not work as expected on a SwiftUI Map. (157612948) (FB19394663)

Workaround: Use simultaneousGesture(TapGesture().onEnded {}) to register the callback.

Memory Tools
Known Issues

Leaks might be falsely reported by memory analysis tools when a target has instances of types that use Obj-C properties implemented in Swift using bridged types with @objc @implementation. Memory analysis tools include the leaks CLI tool, Leaks instrument, and Xcode memory graph debugger. (157798911)

Menu Customization
Known Issues

Menu customization in apps like Notes and Mail might have some visual glitches. (148472167)

Messages
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Sent translated messages do not get re-translated after editing. (149401758)

Fixed: In regions where Screen Unknown Senders is on by default, notifications for message categories are erroneously off by default. (149450560)

Fixed: In one-to-one conversations, background changes might be attributed incorrectly after quitting and re-opening the Messages app. (150548773)

Fixed: Transaction or Promotion messages filtered by a Message Filter App Extension might be badged as “Unknown” in the conversation list rather than “Transaction” or “Promotion”. (151869409)

Known Issues

Users on older devices won’t see compatibility messages for polls, so they might be unaware a poll was sent. (148545742)

Expanding Conversation Details causes the list of conversations to collapse. (149436051)

Workaround: Closing Conversation Details will bring back the list.

Scrolling through a Messages conversation might be sluggish. (152453655)

Workaround: Quit and relaunch Messages.

Metal
New Features

Metal 4 is now supported. See Metal for additional details. (113781091)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: If you’re using Metal 4 command encoders, you should add render and compute pipelines that support indirect command buffers to your residency sets. The Metal device driver currently does not enforce this requirement. (145066238)

Fixed: Metal Shader Validation might not work with shaders that use Metal Performance Primitives. (149263281)

Known Issues

Metal Shader Validation might not work with Metal 4 ray tracing pipelines. (152520367)

Workaround: Selectively disable Shader Validation for pipelines using ray tracing. See documentation.

MetalFX
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Denoised temporal upscaling for MTL4CommandBuffer’s MTL4FXTemporalDenoisedScaler does not work. (146436460)

Fixed: Temporal upscaling for MTL4CommandBuffer’s MTL4FXTemporalScaler does not work. (146436741)

Music
Resolved Issues

Fixed: You might experience audio issues when using the Music app and changing the underlying audio device sample rate. (152465491)

NetworkExtension
Deprecations

Algorithms DES, 3DES, SHA1-96 and SHA1-160 as well as Diffie-Hellman groups less than 14 are no longer supported for IKEv2 VPNs. (148767790)

Notifications
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The icons for Calendar notifications might appear washed out. (151658533)

NSLog
New Features

Dynamic string data in format arguments for NSLog will be redacted to \<private\> in the Unified Logging System. This specifically targets data that enters the Unified Logging System via NSLog, and will not impact the Xcode console or NSLog’s stdout output. If you wish to log un-redacted data to the Unified Logging System please use the “os_log” or “Logger” interfaces. (137129180)

NSTextView
New Features

NSTextView supports sound files, such as QuickTime Audio, attached via NSTextAttachment, by utilizing AVPlayer for playback inline. (140224296)

Object Capture
New Features

A new algorithm significantly improves PhotogrammetrySession reconstruction quality of low-texture objects not captured with the ObjectCaptureSession front end. It will be downloaded and cached once in the background when the PhotogrammetrySession is used at runtime. If network isn’t available at that time, the old low quality model will be used until the new one can be downloaded. There is no code change needed to get this improved model. (145220451)

Photos / Photos Picker
Known Issues

Invoking search in the Photos picker causes the picker to crash. Or invoking Search in a collection in Photos causes Search to crash. (152403781)

Workaround: Use the Photos app to search for the content. Once you’ve found it, you can share or copy it to continue with the workflow. Use Search in the Library tab to find the content.

Photos Picker
Resolved Issues

Fixed: On macOS, the Options menu is missing in the Photos picker. Ability to exclude Location and Captions information cannot be set when using the Photos picker. (152336867)

Quick Look
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Variants menu does not open in Quick Look while trying to view different configurations of a USDZ asset made with Variants. (154817946)

RealityKit
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Entities with a PortalComponent ignore any ModelSortGroupComponent and instead use a fixed rendering order.

In case of sorting rendering issues with portal surface, explicitly add a ModelSortGroupComponent using a .planarUIAlwaysBehind sort group. (149899345)

Fixed: ParticleEmitterComponent does not render properly on iOS, macOS, and tvOS. (152201501)

Fixed: The animate functions on Entity and RealityViewContent do not start animations. (152456435)

Known Issues

Some properties and components do not update SwiftUI Views when accessed through the .observable property on Entity. (147063698)

Rosetta
New Features

You can test that your apps no longer depend on Rosetta by setting the boot-arg nox86exec=1. When this boot-arg is set, any process that would normally run through Rosetta will immediately crash on launch and generate a crash report. This can by set by running sudo nvram boot-args="nox86exec=1" and then rebooting the system. (136764433)

RTL
Known Issues

You might experience layout issues with RTL languages. (151009428)

Safari
Resolved Issues

Fixed: macOS 26 users might experience Safari page loading issues on facebook.com and potentially other websites, due to a new race in the network stack.

Affected users should update to macOS 26 beta 5 and clear related cache by visiting Safari > Settings… > Privacy > Manage Website Data…, then deleting entries for facebook.

and fbcdn.net resources. Restart Safari. Users will need to re-login to the website. Users experiencing issues on other websites can consider clearing cache for those websites or clearing all website data. (153547547)

Known Issues

Black lines appear at the bottom of inactive tabs in Safari. (153681371)

Search
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Some applications might quit unexpectedly when using search. The issue will be resolved automatically with an over-the-air update when connected to Wi-Fi. (157464670)

Secure Text Fields
Resolved Issues

Fixed: On a Mac with a Touch Bar, a secure text field swallows keyboard events in some contexts. For example, this might occur when creating a new user in the Users & Groups settings pane. (151268030)

Security
Deprecations

For apps linked on or after iOS 26 and macOS 26, the default minimum TLS version of URLSession and Network frameworks has changed from 1.0 to 1.2. If your process connects only to your servers, verify that they support TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2. If your process needs to connect to 3rd-party servers which cannot be updated to support newer versions of TLS, restore the previous behavior through URLSession and Security framework APIs: URLSessionConfiguration.tlsMinimumSupportedProtocolVersion and sec_protocol_options_set_min_tls_protocol_version. (135996267)

Settings
Known Issues

Users who enable Reduce Transparency might encounter flickering in background windows or the Dock. (152060485)

If System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Displays have separate Spaces is disabled, WindowServer will crash at login time. (153570422)

Workaround: Boot into Recovery, then mount the Data volume on your partition. Launch Terminal and run rm /Volumes/<Partition Name "Macintosh HD">/Users/<user name>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spaces.plist.

Setup Assistant
Resolved Issues

Fixed: 802.1X Wi-Fi networks are not saved during initial device setup. (147787689)

Fixed: On Intel Macs, the background on the Hello or Welcome screens might be black. (152107967)

Fixed: Visual pairing for Quickly Set Up Mac does not work. (152326903)

Fixed: On the 13” MacBook Air, Hello might be offset from the wallpaper during initial device setup. (152447100)

Shortcuts
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Titles for some Messages actions and filter properties display incorrectly. (153740390)

Siri
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Siri Visual Responses might be illegible behind certain backgrounds. (151682699)

Fixed: Knowledge requests that are handled by ChatGPT might produce results that are based on stale data. (154889929)

StoreKit
New Features

There is a new option for the Transaction.Offer.PaymentMode API called oneTime. This new case supports the method of payment for In-App Purchase offer codes. (142501142)

Subscription promotional offers can now be signed using JWS and attached to a purchase using the new PurchaseOption.promotionalOffer(_:compactJWS:) API. There are also new corresponding SwiftUI APIs in StoreKit to attach a signed promotional offer or a signed introductory offer override to a view. (143395736)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: Subscription status updates might not be reported correctly if the subscription went into billing retry in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (133799135) (FB14789854)

Fixed: Price of offers is not displayed in the payment sheet when making a purchase to a subscription with a higher level of service in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (140635780) (FB15980635)

Fixed: Renewal transactions might be created regardless of the Ask to Buy status of the purchase request in StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (145242611)

Resolved an issue with the Identifiable conformance of the PurchaseIntent API. Conformance to this protocol now begins starting with iOS 18.0 and macOS 15.0. (148751460) (FB17151889)

Fixed: SKProduct from the original StoreKit API fails to decode products when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (150851879)

Resolved an issue where the id member of the PurchaseIntent API was only available starting with iOS 18.0 and macOS 15.0, and no longer available for Mac Catalyst. It is now available starting with iOS 16.4, macOS 14.4, and Mac Catalyst 16.4. The PurchaseIntent conformance to Identifiable remains unchanged. (152858281) (FB17829716)

Fixed: Transactions might not finish, resulting in subsequent purchases of the same product failing. (155449267)

Swift Charts
New Features

Available in iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26, Chart3D allows you to visualize your data and mathematical surfaces in 3D, powered by RealityKit. (148361385)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: Annotations on a scrollable chart might be clipped. (109164195)

Swift Compiler
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The Swift compiler might crash when building a project that initializes a UISymbolContentTransition. (150858005)

Swift Standard Library
Resolved Issues

Fixed: The span properties of InlineArray and CollectionOfOne trap at runtime. (147500528)

Fixed: mutating members of MutableSpan and MutableRawSpan are unavailable. (152467655)

Known Issues

lengthOfBytes(using: .utf16) and -lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding: NSUTF16StringEncoding/NSUnicodeStringEncoding might produce an incorrect result when used on Swift Strings, including NSStrings formed by bridging Swift Strings to Objective-C. (156675395)

SwiftUI
New Features

On macOS, an animated SwiftUI.Transaction that changes a Window‘s size animates the window’s frame, alongside the frame of the hosting view. (61158194)

You can now use View/findNavigator(isPresented:), View/findDisabled(_:), and View/replaceDisabled(_:) to control the presentation of the Find Bar in TextEditor on macOS 26. (85308161)

ControlSize now conforms to Comparable, and View/controlSize(_:) can now be used to clamp the environment’s controlSize to a given range. (99633360) (FB11465757)

In apps built with the macOS 26 SDK, Section footers within a Form of the GroupedFormStyle now have leading alignment, default font, and foreground styles. Use the sectionActions(content:) view modifier on your Section to supply section actions, which maintain a trailing placement in macOS. In iOS and iPadOS, each section action displays as its own form row. (129868475)

Text, TextEditor, and TextField now by default use string contents to determine the appropriate base writing direction for each paragraph, instead of relying on layout directionality. To specify the writing direction explicitly on a per-paragraph basis, use Foundation’s AttributedString.writingDirection attribute. To make the base writing direction follow the layout direction for an entire view, apply the view modifier .writingDirection(strategy: .layoutBased). (134821288)

In apps built with the macOS 26 and iOS 26 SDKs, a Picker view of a style that produces a button-like control now has a fitted sizing behavior by default. If needed, use the buttonSizing(_:) view modifier to make the Picker flexible and fill the available width of its container. (136649748)

The default label style for macOS menu content is now .titleAndIcon. (137306701)

The implementation of some macOS buttons no longer uses NSButton. (139105246)

When linking news SDKs, NavigationLinks produce a single view, rather than a list of views in view list contexts. This change improves performance of many NavigationLinks in lazy containers like List. However, if you are relying on ContainerValues propagating out of the label view of a NavigationLink, or similarly relying on ContainerValues of a ButtonStyle used to style a link, the containerValue(_:,_:) modifier should be moved outside of the link. Below is a minimal example that demonstrates the behavior difference:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
@State private var presentPopover = false
var body: some View {
NavigationLink("Custom Link", value: 84)
.buttonStyle(MyButtonStyle(containerValue: "Eighty-four"))
}
}

struct ParentView: View {
var body: some View {
Group(subviews: ContentView()) { subviews in
ForEach(subviews) { subview in
Text(subview.containerValues.myCustomValue)
}
}
.frame(minWidth: 100, minHeight: 100)
}
}

struct MyButtonStyle: PrimitiveButtonStyle {
var containerValue: String

List no longer ignores the vertical insets of rows with a height close to the default minimum height on iOS and visionOS. Use listRowInsets(_:_:) to change the vertical row insets. (141160852)

In NavigationSplitView and TabViews configured as sidebarAdaptable, the view trailing the sidebar’s safe area is inset in the width of the sidebar. It can display content outside its safe area, underneath the sidebar. (141222137)

In macOS, a Form of the .grouped style now has a more compact appearance when placed within a sidebar or inspector. (141534926)

Reuse existing AppKit gesture recognizers in SwiftUI using NSGestureRecognizerRepresentable, and refer to them by name using name. (142918018)

On macOS, after linking new SDKs, the style of search fields with SearchFieldPlacement.sidebar is now fixed to the toolbar. Previously the search field would scroll as the first element in the list. (143546967)

In apps that adopt the new design, the buttonBorderShape(_:) view modifier can be used to customize the shape of bordered buttons. Previously this modifier only affected buttons in Widgets in macOS. (145773436)

The buttonSizing(_:) view modifier specifies the sizing behavior of Button, Picker, Menu, and other button-producing controls. If you are using Spacer views or an infinite-width frame in your Button label to create a flexible button, apply buttonSizing(.flexible) to the Button instead. (146327046)

In macOS apps that adopt the new design, buttons of the .bordered style can be tinted with the tint(_:) view modifier. (150127133)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: TextEditor’s undo stack might contain invalid operations for applications with multiple TextEditor views. (83650197) (FB9662463)

Fixed: In macOS, Button inherits its environment’s font instead of using a default font appropriate for its controlSize. Apply view modifiers to the button’s label to customize its font. (92434021)

Fixed: In macOS, the value label of MenuPickerStyle does not truncate when it is long enough to cause the button to be wider than its container. (93843377)

Fixed: The menu content of some Menu views does not update as the result of a state change. (106878937)

Fixed: View.onHover(perform:) and View.onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:) affect hit-testing for gestures. Gestures are not received if one of these view modifiers is used within an overlay. (108560020)

Fixed: Section views without isExpanded binding are collapsible in a sidebar-styled List on macOS. (115797465) (FB13192271)

Fixed: listSectionSpacing does not work correctly for sections that have headers and footers. For more control over the list section layout, use the listSectionMargins modifier. (140929163)

Fixed: On iOS, navigationSplitViewColumnWidth() does not respect the specified minimum and maximum column widths. (143529326)

Fixed: Multiple title views in sidebar list labels on iOS are not styled hierarchically as title and subtitle. (144253754)

Fixed: In custom layouts that do not implement explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:), alignment guides do not work correctly for a right-to-left layout direction. (145073832)

Fixed: Applying a bold modifier to Text resets the weight configuration. The interaction of bold and weight is not consistent between Text and Font. (147270079)

Fixed: Environment updates from outside of a popover might fail to propagate into the popover’s content view. (147954025)

Fixed: On platforms supporting edge-attached and non-edge-attached sheets, non-edge-attached sheets present erroneously as full-screen covers when .navigationTransition(.zoom...) is specified. If you wish to keep the full-screen cover in compact size classes, configure a sheet with:

.sheet(...) {
ContentView()
.navigationTransition(.zoom...)
.presentationSizing(.page)
.presentationCompactAdaptation(.fullScreen)

(150455117)

Fixed: If Default Actor Isolation is set to MainActor, @Animatable macro emits concurrency warnings in Swift 5 language mode and does not compile in Swift 6 language mode. (152524435)

Fixed: Gestures do not have the same lower priority over the view’s existing UIGestureRecognizers and NSGestureRecognizers as they do over the view’s existing SwiftUI gestures.

In apps built with iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, use highPriorityGesture(_:isEnabled:) to make sure your gesture takes precedence over the view’s existing gestures, or use simultaneousGesture(_:isEnabled:) to give your gesture the same priority as the view’s existing gestures. (155581361)

Deprecations

Text concatenation using the + operator is deprecated because it makes it hard to create localized strings that are correct across all languages. Use Text interpolation instead. See documentation on Text for more info on how to produce localized strings. (128144043)

TextKit
New Features

iOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, watchOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26 have two methods for resolving the natural alignment NSTextAlignment.natural and the last line of NSTextAlignment.justified into concrete alignments, left and right. The first approach utilizes the UI language, which is determined by passing nil-language to NSParagraphStyle.defaultWritingDirection(forLanguage: ). This behavior was employed prior to this release. The second method is new and dynamically utilizes the base writing direction for the paragraph. When the base writing direction is set to NSWritingDirection.rightToLeft, the text is aligned to right, and vice versa. The behavior is selected by API introduced in this major release: NSTextLayoutManager.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection, NSStringDrawingOptionsResolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection, UITraitCollection.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection, and NSTextField.resolvesNaturalAlignmentWithBaseWritingDirection. (152045248)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: The directionality of NSParagraphStyle indentation properties (firstLineHeadIndent, headIndent, and tailIndent) is determined by inconsistent hidden rules implemented by the TextKit typesetting engine.

With iOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, the TextKit 2 typesetting engine has been standardized to utilize the resolved writing direction for the paragraph when linked with the OS 26 versions of the corresponding SDKs. For binary compatibility, applications developed with prior SDK versions will use the UI language in a subset of API interfaces. Specifically, for UILabel, NSTextField, SwiftUI.Text, and NSStringDrawing, the indentation directionality is determined by the UI language queried by passing nil to NSParagraphStyle. defaultWritingDirection() in applications built with prior SDK versions. (155893102)

TextKit 2
New Features

A new property, includesTextListMarkers, is introduced to NSTextList, NSTextContentStorage, and NSWritingToolsCoordinator. This property controls whether to include the text list marker string in the contents of NSAttributedString for paragraphs associated with NSTextList. TextKit 1 expects the marker string, while TextKit 2 does not. The TextKit 2 behavior was adopted by UIKit starting with iOS 18 (includesTextListMarkers=NO). AppKit is also adopting the TextKit 2 text list behavior starting with macOS 26. (128479184)

Translation
Known Issues

For Catalyst apps using .translationTask(), buttons in the download approval UI might not work. (151313115)

Workaround: Either manually download the languages you need beforehand from System Settings, or build your Catalyst app with the “Optimize for Mac” setting.

UIKit
New Features

In TextKit 2, the includesTextListMarkers property has been introduced to NSTextList, NSTextContentStorage and NSWritingToolsCoordinator. For paragraphs associated with NSTextList, the property controls whether to include the text list marker string in the NSAttributedString contents. The classes within TextKit 1 expect the marker string, while the classes within TextKit 2 do not. (144903293)

VideoToolbox
Resolved Issues

Fixed: You might experience decoding performance issues for high-bitrate HEVC, resulting in stuttering and lag. (153243806)

Virtual Machines
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Virtual machine networking fails if you start a bridge mode VM while a shared or host mode VM is running, and vice versa. The networking of the existing VM is not affected. (151477625)

Weather
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Users might see a blank white button on some tips for Weather features. The button will be operable. (152088799)

WebKit API
New Features

The load APIs on WebPage now return an AsyncSequence directly that can be used to track relevant navigation events. The currentNavigationEvent property has been removed in favor of the navigations property, which produces an indefinite sequence directly. (152414525)

The WebPage API now supports directly loading URLs. Additionally, when loading an HTML string, there is now a default value for the baseURL parameter. (152904248) (FB17850359)

Resolved Issues

Fixed: webViewOnScrollGeometryChange might report an incorrect content size. (146576790)

Known Issues

WKPreferences.isLookToScrollEnabled is not available on non-visionOS platforms. (152106377)

Xcode
Resolved Issues

Fixed: Xcode Previews usage frequently panics on macOS 26.0 Tahoe beta 4. (141641869)
